	<h1>Stage 1: The History of JavaScript</h1>

	<p>Allow me tell you a story:
	<br><br>
	Long ago, my master wishs to have his own scripting language and created me in mere 10 days. Because I was such a weirdo who can interpret language in any paradigm I want and sometimes confuse programmers all the time, I was bullied at my school. I used to be the most hated programming language in a town and thought I want to die.
	<br><br>
	But my master didn't give up on me. He helped to support me in a time of hardships and train me day after day without taking a break. Now, I'm one of the most popular programming languages in the world and happily married to a beautiful wife and have 4 wonderful kids. My kids - React.js, Vue.js, Angular.js, and Node.js have excelled in an elite schools and they are employed in a famous companies. Despite that, they're still humble, kind, and helpful to fellow programming languages and their frameworks. I'm so proud of them!
	<br><br>
	I never felt happier than before in my entire life and it's all thanks to my master who believed in me! I'm eternally grateful to him. :')
	<br><br>
	By the way, what is the name of my master?</p>
